# <i class="fa-solid fa-play" style="color: #ff0000;"></i> Video player

I created a custom video player with fully functional controls. Throughout the project, I explored various CSS techniques, including some that were initially challenging for me. It was a very satisfying experience to build this project on my own.

OBS: This code only works with videos located in the "videos" directory. I used fixed file names and supported only MP4 format, as my main goal was to design the layout of the video player and test whether the functionalities were working correctly.
